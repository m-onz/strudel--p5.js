# strudel--p5.js

little example combining [strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). I want to create audio visual art as a web page that combines p5.js + strudel / webpd. I have already got webpd + p5.js working but strudel seemed a bit more tricky. Thanks to [Felix Roos](https://github.com/felixroos) I managed to get this basic example of a read-only strudel with visuals.

Based on [this example](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/blob/main/packages/core/examples/vanilla.html).
